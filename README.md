# Reaction-Timer

##Description
It is a basic project done to learn more about vue.js and its lifecycle methods. 
This is a simple reaction timer that measures your reaction time. It's a fun and interactive way to test your reflexes! Hope you're not a slow poke.

## How it Works
The program will randomly prompt you to click on a block. The time taken between the prompt appearing on the screen and your action is your reaction time.
